<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is my favorite chocolate chip pancake recipe — it's so easy! I often 
    make it for family and friends. You may want to double the recipe because 
    these soft, fluffy pancakes go quickly.

<ul>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled</li>
    <li>½ cup miniature chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Whisk milk and egg together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl. Stir in 
        melted butter, then whisk in milk mixture until smooth. Fold in 
        chocolate chips. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat a small nonstick skillet over low heat. Pour about 1/3 cup batter 
        into the hot skillet and cover with a lid. Cook pancake until browned on 
        the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip pancake, then cover and cook until 
        browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat 
        to make remaining pancakes.
